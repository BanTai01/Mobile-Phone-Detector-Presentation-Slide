The Mobile Phone Detector project utilizes the CA3130 operational amplifier IC, grounded
in EEE principles, to create a compact device detecting mobile phone transmissions
within a 1.5-meter range. Key components include the CA3130 IC, which functions as
an operational amplifier, and a tailored circuit for identifying calls and SMS. 
The detector proves valuable in restricted areas like examination halls, triggering a beep alarm
and LED indicator upon detecting RF signals from active mobile phones, even in silent
mode. The alarm persists until signal transmission ceases
